# BW Chaos But Shitty [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/contains-tasty-spaghetti-code.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)
I was bored and wanted to completely break boneworks, so I made this.

There's already [an actually decent chaos mod](https://github.com/extraes/BW-Chaos) for boneworks and this one is objectively way worse than it so there's really no reason to use this.
